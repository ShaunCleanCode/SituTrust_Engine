## **6. Discussion and Future Work**

### **6.1 Implications of Prompt-Native Multi-Agent Systems**

Our experimental results demonstrate that **prompt-native multi-agent collaboration** is not only feasible but can achieve sophisticated coordination without external orchestration. This finding has profound implications for the future of AI collaboration systems, suggesting that complex organizational behaviors can emerge from carefully crafted prompts alone.

### **6.2 Limitations and Challenges**

While SituTrust shows promising results, several limitations warrant discussion:

1. **Scalability**: Current experiments focus on small teams (3-5 agents). Larger teams may require more sophisticated trust modeling.
2. **Domain Specificity**: Results are primarily from business and technical domains. Generalization to other fields needs further investigation.
3. **Prompt Engineering Complexity**: Creating effective spatial and trust prompts requires significant expertise.

### **6.3 Future Research Directions**

1. **Advanced Trust Modeling**: Incorporating more sophisticated trust dynamics and reputation systems
2. **Multi-Modal Spatial Context**: Extending spatial prompting to include visual and auditory elements
3. **Long-term Memory**: Implementing persistent memory systems for extended collaboration
4. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Testing SituTrust across diverse domains and cultural contexts

## **8. Conclusion**

SituTrust represents a significant advancement in prompt-native multi-agent systems, demonstrating that sophisticated collaboration can emerge from carefully designed prompts without external orchestration. Our work opens new avenues for research in emergent AI behaviors and provides a practical framework for building autonomous collaborative systems.

The success of SituTrust suggests that the future of AI collaboration may lie not in complex external controllers, but in the art of prompt engineering that can encode organizational intelligence directly into language models.
