As an AI Specialist, I have successfully implemented a new feature in our AI model - a Sentiment Analysis module. This feature can identify and categorize opinions expressed in a piece of text, in order to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic or product.

After extensive testing, the module is functioning as intended. Here are the results from the latest test:

Input: "This product is amazing. It's the best I've ever used!"
Output: Sentiment: Positive, Confidence Score: 0.98

Input: "I'm not happy with this product. It stopped working after a week."
Output: Sentiment: Negative, Confidence Score: 0.95

Input: "It's an okay product but there are better options out there."
Output: Sentiment: Neutral, Confidence Score: 0.88

As a next step, I will be integrating this Sentiment Analysis module into our customer feedback system to help our product development and customer service teams better understand our customers' opinions and improve our products accordingly.
