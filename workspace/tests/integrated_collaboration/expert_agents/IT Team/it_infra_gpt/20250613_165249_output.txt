Sure, here is a sample output for my main responsibility:

Project: Implementing Scalable IT Infrastructure for XYZ Corporation

1. Network Infrastructure Design: Designed the network infrastructure consisting of redundant switches, routers, and firewalls to ensure high availability and scalability. The design incorporates VLANs for segregating network traffic and enhancing security. 

2. Server Infrastructure: Implemented a cluster of virtual servers using technologies such as VMware and Hyper-V. The design includes load balancing and failover capabilities to ensure the smooth operation of applications and services.

3. Storage Infrastructure: Designed a Storage Area Network (SAN) using iSCSI technology. This infrastructure is capable of expanding storage capacity as needed, ensuring scalability.

4. Cloud Integration: Created an integration plan with cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. This includes setting up Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), cloud storage, and cloud databases.

5. Disaster Recovery Plan: Drafted a disaster recovery plan that includes regular backups, both on-site and off-site, and a recovery procedure to ensure business continuity.

6. Security Measures: Implemented security measures in the design, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and encryption for data at rest and in transit.

7. Monitoring and Maintenance: Established procedures for regular monitoring of the infrastructure to identify and rectify issues before they impact the system's performance. 

This design aims to provide a scalable and reliable IT infrastructure that can support the growing needs of XYZ Corporation.
