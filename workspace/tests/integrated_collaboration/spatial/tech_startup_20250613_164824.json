  "prompt": "Physical Environment:\n\nThe physical meeting environment will be a modern, technologically equipped conference room with a large table to accommodate all participants. Natural daylight will stream in from large windows, creating an open and inviting atmosphere. The room will be well-ventilated with temperature controls to ensure comfort, as physical comfort greatly influences the mental state and productivity of the participants.\n\nThe table will be equipped with integrated charging ports and high-speed internet connectivity to support the use of laptops and other digital devices. A large, clear, interactive whiteboard will be at one end of the room, facilitating brainstorming, project visualization, and real-time collaboration. Beside the whiteboard, a high-resolution projector or screen will be installed for presentations, data analysis, or video conferencing with remote team members. \n\nComfortable, ergonomic chairs will be provided to support prolonged periods of sitting, while a small lounge area with a couch and soft armchairs will provide a more relaxed space for breakout sessions or casual discussions. \n\nPsychological Environment:\n\nThe meeting room will be designed to foster a high trust, strategic collaboration, and rapid iteration environment. The room's layout will be circular, promoting equality and balanced participation, as there is no head of the table. This design subconsciously encourages open communication, as everyone can maintain eye contact and no one is physically dominating the space.\n\nThe room's color scheme will be neutral and calming, with shades of soft blues, greens, and greys to promote focus and minimize visual distractions. The room will be well lit, but with adjustable lighting that can be dimmed or brightened depending on the activity and time of day. \n\nThe room will also be equipped with noise cancellation features to minimize external distractions and promote concentrated discussions. \n\nTo foster a collaborative mood, inspiring artwork, and motivational quotes related to teamwork and innovation could be displayed on the walls. \n\nParticipants will be encouraged to leave their titles at the door, fostering a level playing field where everyone's ideas are valued equally. The meeting facilitator will ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute, promoting an atmosphere of inclusivity and mutual respect. \n\nA small refreshment corner with healthy snacks, water, coffee, and tea will be available to keep the participants energized and hydrated. The room will be kept clean and clutter-free, promoting a sense of order and focus.\n\nIn this environment, the participants will feel comfortable, valued, and motivated to collaborate effectively on the development and launch of the AI-powered project management platform.",
