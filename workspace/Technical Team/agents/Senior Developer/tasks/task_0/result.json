For full functionality, additional code should be added as per your project needs.\n\n```python\nclass Features:\n    def __init__(self, features):\n        self.features = features\n\n    def auth(self):\n        print(\"Authentication feature should be implemented here.\")\n        \n    def api(self):\n        print(\"API feature should be implemented here.\")\n        \n    def execute_features(self):\n        for feature in self.features:\n            if hasattr(self, feature):\n                getattr(self, feature)()\n            else:\n                print(f\"Feature '{feature}' not found.\")\n                \nfeatures = Features([\"auth\", \"api\"])\nfeatures.execute_features()\n```\n\nThis is Python code implementing a `Feature` class that accepts a list of feature names. \n\nThe `execute_features` method iterates over the list of feature names, checks if a method with that name exists in the class, and if it does, it executes the method.\n\nCurrently, the `auth` and `api` methods only print a message, but in a real-world situation, you'd replace this with the actual code implementing the features.\n\nPlease replace `\"Authentication feature should be implemented here.\"` and `\"API feature should be implemented here.\"` with the actual code required for the respective features.",
